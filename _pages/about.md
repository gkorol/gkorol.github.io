Hi! My name is Guilherme dos Santos Korol, I work as an AI/ML compiler engineer at the AI Competence Center at [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/). My research/work topics are **Compilers** and **Computer Architecture** for **Deep Learning**. 

### *More about me:*
From May 2024 to July 2025 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chair for Compiler Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about) (CCC) at the Computer Science Department of [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en). My postdoc activites were centered around the [Myrtus EU Project](https://myrtus-project.eu/), particularly within the [Design and Programming Environment](https://myrtus-project.eu/myrtus-dpe/) pillar. During that time, I have also worked on a compiler-supported optimization technique for skipping layers/blocks of Deep Neural Networks (DNN).  
Before all that, I carried out my PhD with the [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/) program at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (UFRGS) in Brazil. There, I worked under the supervision of Professor [Antonio Beck](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~caco/). Between September 2022 and April 2023, I was also with the CCC under the supervision of Professor [Jeronimo Castrillon](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-staff-castrillon). In that time, my work targeted efficient execution of DNNs on FPGAs. I investigated how optimization methods (from the ones at the hardware level like approximate computing and HLS to the ones at the DNN level like pruning, quantization, and early-exit) can improve the FPGA execution of DNNs - especially under constrained environments like the IoT-edge.

For my MSc degree (from 2019 to 2020), I joined the [Microelectronics](http://www.ufrgs.br/pgmicro) program at UFRGS working on general-purpose reconfigurable computing. I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.pucrs.br/) (PUCRS) in 2018. Part of my bachelor (three terms) was taken at the [University of Colorado at Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/) (CU Denver). Back then, as a bachelor student, I took part in my first research project as a research intern at the [Capitol Technology University](https://www.captechu.edu/) (Laurel/MD) at the end of my exchange at CU Denver. This project was a partnership with NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/index.html). After the exchange, I worked on a few other research projects, like designing a full-VHDL CNN accelerator for my final bachelor project
