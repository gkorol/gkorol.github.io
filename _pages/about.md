My name is Guilherme dos Santos Korol, I share my week as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chair for Compiler Construction](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-about) (CCC) at the Computer Science Department of [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) and as an AI engineer at the AI Competence Center at [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/). My research areas are **Computer Architecture** and **Compilers** for **Deep Learning**. 

### *More about me:*

For my PhD, I was with the [Computer Science](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/ppgc/) program at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial) (UFRGS) in Brazil. There, I worked under the supervision of Professor [Antonio Beck](http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~caco/). Between September 2022 and April 2023, I was also with the CCC under the supervision of Professor [Jeronimo Castrillon](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/ccc-staff-castrillon). In my PhD, my work targeted efficient execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on FPGAs. I investigated how optimization methods (from the ones at the hardware level like approximate computing and HLS to the ones at the DNN level like pruning, quantization, and early-exit) can improve the FPGA execution of DNNs - especially under constrained environments like the IoT-edge.

I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul](https://www.pucrs.br/) (PUCRS) in 2018. I also took classes abroad at the [University of Colorado at Denver](https://www.ucdenver.edu/) (CU Denver) for three terms during my bachelor. After, I joined the [Microelectronics](http://www.ufrgs.br/pgmicro) program at UFRGS, where I got my MSc degree in 2020 (on general-purpose reconfigurable computing).

Before all that, I have worked as an electronic technician for a few companies before focusing on research. Then, as a bachelor student, I took part in my first research project as a research intern at the [Capitol Technology University](https://www.captechu.edu/) (Laurel/MD) at the end of my exchange at CU Denver. This project was a partnership with NASA's [Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/index.html). After the exchange, I worked on a few other research projects, like designing a full-VHDL CNN accelerator for my final bachelor project, before starting my Masters's.
